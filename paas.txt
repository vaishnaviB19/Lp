Here’s a step-by-step guide to **design and deploy a simple web application on a free PaaS (Platform as a Service) environment**, using **Render.com**, which provides a free tier and is simple to use.

### ✅ **Project: Simple Flask Web App Deployment on Render (PaaS)**

#### **Step 1: Create a Simple Web Application**

Create a file structure like this:

```
flask-app/
│
├── app.py
├── requirements.txt
└── render.yaml
```

#### **`app.py`**

```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return "Hello from Flask deployed on Render!"

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

#### **`requirements.txt`**

```
flask
```

#### **`render.yaml`**

```yaml
services:
  - type: web
    name: flask-app
    env: python
    plan: free
    buildCommand: "pip install -r requirements.txt"
    startCommand: "python app.py"
```

---

### ✅ **Step 2: Push Code to GitHub**

1. Initialize git:

   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```
2. Create a new repository on [GitHub](https://github.com) and push your code:

   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/flask-app.git
   git push -u origin master
   ```

---

### ✅ **Step 3: Deploy to Render**

1. Go to [https://render.com](https://render.com) and sign up/log in.
2. Click **"New + → Web Service"**.
3. Connect your GitHub and select your repository.
4. Render will auto-detect your `render.yaml` file and deploy the app.
5. Wait for the deployment to finish (you’ll see logs), and Render will give you a **live URL**.

---

### ✅ **Deployment Result**

You now have a working Flask web application running on a PaaS platform. The app is publicly accessible on the URL provided by Render.
